To make a website responsive, I first stated my meta tag: which is "<meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">"
     this tell search engines important information about my web page, 
     from there, i wrote my feww codes, including my p tag.

     I didn't rally fine problem writing the html tag because it was familiar with me.


     and then i linked my style.css and started to write my scc codes.
     i found it difficult to make it responsive I was mixing up thuings that wan't needed at all in the codes.
      so with few more try and eroos, i was able to find my mistakes, which after correcting, made my page responsive to jsut 2 viewports instaed of 3.
       i continued with my try and eroos until .... finally, i got a hint to what my problem was .
       it was that i was mixing up the min and the max.
        so after correctly arranging the min and the max....
        i go what i was expected of .
         thank you.
